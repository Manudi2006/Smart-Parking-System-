Parkers is a smart parking solution designed to reduce congestion and improve user experience in shopping malls by providing real-time parking availability and innovative parking management features.

## Problem Statement
Drivers in shopping malls face difficulties finding available parking spaces and locating their parked vehicles, especially during peak hours. This leads to congestion, time wastage, and user frustration due to the lack of real-time information and guidance systems.

## Purpose
This project was developed as part of an academic module focused on identifying real-world problems and proposing innovative technology-based solutions. The objective was to analyze parking inefficiencies in shopping malls and design a smart parking system to improve operational efficiency and user convenience.

## Key Features
- Real-time parking availability
- QR-based entry system
- Digital payments
- Vehicle tracking ("Find My Vehicle")
- Vehicle verification via ANPR
- EV-friendly parking options
